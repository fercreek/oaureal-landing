## Code Quality

### Clean Code Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Extract magic numbers and strings to constants
- Comment "why", not "what" - code should be self-explanatory

### Code Formatting
- Use consistent formatting (Prettier recommended)
- Maximum line length: 100-120 characters
- Use meaningful variable names: `isLoading` not `flag`
- Use descriptive function names: `handleSubmit` not `onClick`

## Git & Version Control

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- One logical change per commit
- Example: `feat: add hero section with animations`

### Branch Strategy
- Use feature branches: `feature/hero-section`, `fix/header-styling`
- Keep branches small and focused
- Regularly sync with main branch

## Documentation

### Code Comments
- Document complex logic and algorithms
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Use JSDoc for public APIs and functions

### README
- Keep README up to date with setup instructions
- Document environment variables
- Include examples of common workflows

## Performance

### Bundle Size
- Monitor bundle size regularly
- Use dynamic imports for large dependencies
- Tree-shake unused code
- Optimize images and assets with Next.js Image component

### Runtime Performance
- Profile before optimizing
- Use React DevTools Profiler
- Optimize expensive operations
- Lazy load non-critical components with Next.js dynamic imports

## Security

### Best Practices
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Accessibility

### WCAG Guidelines
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet standards
- Use ARIA labels when needed
- Test with screen readers

## Browser Compatibility

### Support
- Test in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Use progressive enhancement
- Provide fallbacks for newer features
- Test on mobile devices

## Testing

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests for business logic
- Test user interactions and flows
- Use integration tests for critical paths
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names: `should render hero with title`
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test edge cases and error states
- Keep tests maintainable and readable
